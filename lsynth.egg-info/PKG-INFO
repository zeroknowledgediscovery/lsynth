MAP-alignment fidelity and dataset distance for synthetic tabular data

This package implements the one-sided MAP-alignment fidelity statistic
introduced by Chattopadhyay *et al.* and described in the manuscript
"How Good Is Your Synthetic Data?".


The core idea
-------------

For a synthetic record to be realistic, each coordinate should agree
with the conditional MAP prediction inferred from real data.

Formally, for a data record ``x`` and coordinate ``i``::

    υ(x, i) = φ_i(x_i | x_{-i}) / max_y φ_i(y | x_{-i})

Averaged over samples and coordinates::

    Υ(D) in [0,1]

- High ``Υ``: synthetic preserves *real conditional structure*
- Low ``Υ``: structural distortion (even if marginals / covariance match)



Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install lsynth



Interpretation
--------------

- ~1.0: synthetic matches conditional structure closely
- ~0.7: Gaussian-like distortions
- < 0.7: strong structural mismatch

Why MAP-alignment?
------------------

Because covariance matching is insufficient.

Section VII of the manuscript gives explicit examples where:

- Real and synthetic share identical means, variances, covariance matrices
- Yet they differ strongly in conditional structure
- MAP-alignment catches the discrepancy immediately

This method:

- Detects nonlinear and higher-order structure
- Avoids feature-embedding artifacts
- Comes with finite-sample uncertainty control

Supported Generators
--------------------

- ``"LSM"``: use QuasiNet as a generative model via ``qsample``
- ``"BASELINE"``: independent-column null model
- ``"CTGAN"``: uses SDV CTGAN synthesizer
- Custom generators also supported
